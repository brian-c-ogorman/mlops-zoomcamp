# MLOps Zoomcamp

This repository is to track work and homework for the [DataTalksClub MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).

**Note**: Jupyter Notebooks in the [notebooks](notebooks/) directory will be committed in the `.Rmd` format using the [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) library. To convert any of the `.Rmd` files to a jupyter notebook, run the following

```
jupytext --to notebook filename.Rmd
```
